## What is CutPlan?
 
CutPlan is a feature of Optitex 15.3.415.0 that allows you to create cut orders based on different styles, sizes, colors, and fabrics. CutPlan groups sizes that can be placed within the same marker and computes the required number of plies, in order to fulfill the order requirements.
 
CutPlan uses an algorithm to calculate the best cut order solution for your needs. You can choose an algorithm with or without nesting. Nesting allows you to see the actual spread of the materials on your table and creates an MRK file that can be opened with Optitex Marker[^2^].
 
## How to Use CutPlan?
 
To use CutPlan, you need to have Optitex 15.3.415.0 installed on your computer and a valid CutPlan Serial Key. You can get a CutPlan Serial Key from Optitex or from authorized resellers[^3^].
 
Once you have the software and the key, follow these steps to create a cut order:
 
1. Launch Optitex 15.3.415.0 and click on the CutPlan icon on the toolbar.
2. Create a new cut order or open an existing one.
3. Add styles to your cut order by clicking on the Add Style button.
4. Select the style file (PDS) and enter the number of pieces for each size, color, and fabric type.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the styles you want to include in your cut order.
6. Click on the Calculate button to generate the cut order solution.
7. Review the cut order solution and make any adjustments if needed.
8. Click on the Save button to save your cut order.
9. Click on the Export button to export your cut order as a CSV file or as an MRK file if you used nesting.
10. Print or send your cut order to your production team or your cutting machine.

- Saving time, money, and fabric by automatically grouping sizes that can be placed within the same marker and optimizing fabric usage.
- Increasing productivity by using an algorithm to calculate the best cut order solution for your needs.
