However, there is a catch: the ICT PDF 65 is not available for free. You have to pay a hefty fee of $1,500 to access it. That's a lot of money for most people, especially if you are just starting out in forex trading.
 
So, is there a way to download the ICT PDF 65 for free? The answer is yes, but you have to be careful. There are many websites that claim to offer the ICT PDF 65 for free, but most of them are scams. They will either ask you to fill out surveys, provide your personal information, or download malware on your device.
 
The only safe and legal way to download the ICT PDF 65 for free is to join the ICT Mentorship Program.
