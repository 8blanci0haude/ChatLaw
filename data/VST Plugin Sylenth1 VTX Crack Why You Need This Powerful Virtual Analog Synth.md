## How to Install Sylenth1 VTX
 
To install Sylenth1 VTX, you need to download the plugin from the official website of LennarDigital[^1^]. You can choose between a 32-bit or a 64-bit version, depending on your system and DAW. You will also need a license key to activate the plugin, which you can purchase from the same website.
 
Once you have downloaded the plugin, you need to extract the zip file and copy the .dll file to your VST folder. If you are using a Mac, you need to copy the .vst or .component file to your AU folder. You can find these folders in the following locations:
 
- Windows: C:\Program Files\VstPlugins or C:\Program Files (x86)\VstPlugins
- Mac: /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST or /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components

After copying the file, you need to rename it to "Sylenth1 - VTX" or whatever name is specified in the error message when you try to load a project that uses this plugin[^4^]. This is a workaround for some compatibility issues that may occur with some DAWs.
 
Now you can launch your DAW and scan for new plugins. You should be able to find Sylenth1 VTX in your plugin list and load it on a track. The first time you open it, you will be asked to enter your license key. After that, you can start using the plugin as normal.

## How to Use Sylenth1 VTX
 
Sylenth1 VTX has a similar interface and functionality as the original Sylenth1. It has four unison oscillators, two filter sections, two ADSR envelopes, two LFOs, a modulation matrix, an arpeggiator, a distortion unit, a phaser, a chorus/flanger, an equalizer, a delay and a reverb. You can use these modules to shape your sound in various ways.
 
To get started, you can browse through the presets that come with the plugin. You can find them in the menu at the top left corner of the interface. You can also load your own presets or create new ones from scratch. To save a preset, click on the menu button at the top right corner of the interface and choose "Save Preset As". You can also export or import presets as .fxb or .fxp files.
 
To create your own sound, you can start by choosing a waveform for each oscillator. You can choose between sawtooth, pulse, triangle or noise waveforms. You can also adjust the volume, phase, detune, stereo width and panning of each oscillator. You can also enable unison mode for each oscillator, which adds up to eight voices per oscillator for a thicker sound. You can adjust the unison detune, stereo spread and phase randomness of each voice.
 
Next, you can route the oscillators to one or both of the filter sections. Each filter section has four filter types: low pass, high pass, band pass and band stop. You can also adjust the cutoff frequency, resonance, drive and key tracking of each filter. You can also enable filter FM mode for each filter section, which modulates the cutoff frequency with one of the oscillators for more complex sounds.
 
After that, you can use the envelopes and LFOs to modulate various parameters of the oscillators and filters. You can adjust the attack, decay, sustain and release of each envelope. You can also adjust the rate, shape, gain
